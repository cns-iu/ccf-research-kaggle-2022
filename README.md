# Segmenting functional tissue units across human organs using community-driven development of generalizable machine learning algorithms

The development of a reference atlas of the healthy human body requires automated image segmentation of major anatomical structures across multiple organs based on spatial bioimages generated from various sources with differences in sample preparation. We present the setup and results of the “Hacking the Human Body” machine learning algorithm development competition hosted by the Human Biomolecular Atlas (HuBMAP) and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) teams on the Kaggle platform. We showcase how 1,175 teams from 78 countries engaged in community-driven, open-science code development that resulted in machine learning models which successfully segment anatomical structures across five organs using histology images from two consortia and that will be productized in the HuBMAP data portal to process large datasets at scale in support of Human Reference Atlas construction. We discuss the benchmark data created for the competition, major challenges faced by the participants, and the winning models and strategies.
