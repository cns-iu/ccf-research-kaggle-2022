# Segmenting functional tissue units across human organs using community-driven development of generalizable machine learning algorithms

The development of a [reference atlas of the healthy human body at the single-cell resolution](https://hubmapconsortium.org/) requires the segmentation of major anatomical structures. Manual segmentation is time consuming and not feasible due to the massive amounts of data that needs to be analyzed. To accelerate progress, efficient machine learning algorithms are needed that can segment structures such as functional tissue units (FTUs) in histological images across different organs. This repository contains code used to prepare a coding competition on Google’s ML community platform, Kaggle, that focuses on the development of machine learning algorithms that reliably segment FTUs and are generalizable across organs and robust across dataset differences.  

The repo is structured in the following way:
