This directory contains the data preprocessing code for running the baseline model.
Run the notebooks in the following order:
- Generating_masks_1.ipynb
- RLE_from_mask_and_csvs_gen_2.ipynb
- Datasplitting_3.ipynb

The above notebook creates dataset in structure suitable to run the baseline model (first place winning solution from the previous ["HuBMAP - Hacking The Kidney"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hubmap-kidney-segmentation) kaggle competition). Instructions to run the model can be found in `1-Tom` directory.
